        The goal of this research was to examine different distributions of health traits in clusters of patients that share ancestry with each other. We strongly emphasize that our research does not support a genetic basis for any of the differences reported here. Instead, a more likely explanation is that complex sociocultural, environmental, and genetic factors all interact to shape how and why an individual would seek medical care. The clusters reported here may have some overlap in these factors, leading to the differences observed.

        Here, we attempt to define the relevant terms of the paper, along with what conclusions our research does and does not support. Further questions can be addressed to christa@g.ucla.edu

        We used an unsupervised machine learning algorithm coupled with genetic information to identify clusters of related people who visit the UCLA Health System. These clusters might be a more effective and precise way to study people in the context of medical research. Using our approach, we were able to study clusters that would be hard to identify via self-reported data alone. Some of these clusters represent groups of people who are not regularly studied in American biomedical literature, like Iranian Jews or Armenians.
      </p>
      <p>
        We found that some of the clusters we identified had health differences. These differences could be in terms of the diagnoses the people in the cluster received, what specialties they visited, or the genetic risk variants common in the cluster. Our data can be used to examine health disparities that exist in Los Angeles, and the complex generative processes that might be causing different clusters to access care.

        The results here are strictly correlative. The reasons why a cluster is more likely to be diagnosed with a specific disease or see a particular doctor are complicated and not necessarily related to their actual health. Factors that could affect how a cluster interacts with the health system could relate to insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, biases of the medical establishment, travel time to the hospitals, among many others. Thus, belonging to a cluster is not causal for any of the associations reported in our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the sample we are using is not random. Firstly, the participants are people who visited the hospital and had a blood draw, which is a subset of the population. Beyond that, people who agree to take part in a biobank are likely not representative of the general population. Lastly, the setting of this study was Southern California, and most participants live in the US full time. It is unclear how a cluster of people from the US generalize to analogous populations outside of the US.

        that may be affecting care in Los Angeles. For example, if a cluster is visiting an emergency room more often than other clusters, that could provide an opportunity to investigate whether there is a structural cause for this difference. Maybe people in that cluster have worse insurance coverage or they travel farther to a doctor’s office. We hope our work provides the foundation to look at these questions and design interventions to address potential inequities.

      </p>
      <p>
        In this work, however, and often in informal language, genetic ancestry often means how you share DNA with people from a specific geographic area or cultural group. This is because we share DNA with a long line of individuals, way beyond what we could recognize as our family tree. Many of these distant ancestors primarily interacted with others in a similar geographic area (e.g., the Austrian Alps) or within a sociocultural boundary (e.g., others who spoke Urdu). Over time, our ancestors accumulated unique mutations that they passed on to their offspring. Since they often married or mated with other people from their area or culture, these mutations stayed in the gene pool in that group. These patterns often persist into the present moment, as religion, language, and ancestry often still influence marriage decisions. Thus, today there are

        Genetic ancestry is a continuum, which makes it particularly difficult to encapsulate. For example, it is common for an individual to have parents with different ancestral backgrounds. Consider the offspring of a woman from Population A and a man from Population B. While it is correct to say that the baby has ancestry shared equally with Population A and B, at any given position on one of the baby’s chromosomes, it is either completely Population A or Population B. This subtle difference is the difference between

        Today in the United States, people typically identify as one of several races delineated by the US Census, such as White, Black, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander. Ethnicity in the US Census is usually considered to be Hispanic or not Hispanic. Race and ethnicity can interact in complex ways with an individual’s identity, which may be limited to their race/ethnicity (e.g. someone identifying as white non-Hispanic) or could span cultural lines separate from the typical US designations (e.g. Pakistani Muslim).

People who share large amounts of IBD with each other are more likely to be closely related. However, even small amounts of IBD shared between people can be informative, since they indicate shared ancestors in the more distant past.

      <p>
        In this study, we used an algorithm to make a network of individuals. We used a machine-learning algorithm to identify clusters of people who shared more IBD between them than other groups of people. IBD cluster detection done in this manner has been shown to find groups who likely have genetic ancestors in common. This approach is functionally different from assigning an ancestry at each point in the genome but can still give us information on how individuals in our biobank are related, which is useful when asking about health risks in the Los Angeles area.

        We were particularly interested in IBD in the context of a biobank because it offered more information about clusters than information contained in the EHR alone. While doctor’s offices regularly take down information about race and ethnicity, sometimes it may be inaccurate or not included for whatever reason. As a result, our sample size would decrease, and substantially limit our ability to identify health inequities.

        Additionally, the racial and ethnic categories typically included on forms are usually simplistic. For example, there is

        While we examined whether a PheCode was more or less prevalent in a cluster, our results do not say that belonging to a cluster is causal for having a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results displayed here are statistical associations, meaning that we observed a relationship between cluster membership and ever being diagnosed with a PheCode (or visiting a specialty or a zip code). These observations can be considered robust under some mathematical guidelines commonly used in science (such as

        ), but they do not say anything about causality. In other words, there may be some observed correlation of individuals within a particular cluster who are more likely to be diagnosed with a PheCode than individuals in another cluster, however, this does not mean cluster membership is causal for these differences.

        There are many possible explanations for what we see in our data. Of course, the population could truly have that disease at a higher rate than other groups. This is easy to imagine in cases like sickle cell anemia. We observed that sickle cell anemia is more likely to be diagnosed in Black people in our study, and there has been a large body of

        to have sickle cell anemia than people from other groups. However, many of the associations we found have less clear explanations. It is possible that certain groups receive or seek care at greater rates or that there is an environmental factor affecting the diagnoses. In some cases, it might be true that certain doctors that see specific populations are more likely to code an illness in a specific way. There are likely biases in the way diseases are diagnosed. For example, in sickle cell anemia, it could be true that doctors are familiar with the research on the association between the disease and Black Americans, and thus test or treat it at higher rates in this group, despite it also being common in

        Taken together, all these considerations mean that there is likely a complex explanation for the results that we see. Future research directions can focus on untangling the structural processes (like race, socioeconomic factors, sexual and gender identity, or others) that cause patients to receive a particular diagnosis to address health disparities.

        In this study, we did not examine the relationship between genetics and disease. While it may be true that some of the associations that we observe may have some genetic basis, the data presented here are not sufficient to make these kinds of conclusions. Instead, there could be other social and structural factors contributing to the associations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A concrete example is that while we observed that the Armenian cluster was more likely to receive codes relating to heart transplants, the actual reason for this could be more complicated than genetics alone. Perhaps people in the Armenian cluster share some sort of unmeasured environmental factor that affects heart health. Or, maybe the Armenian cluster doesn’t receive more heart transplants overall, they just receive more at UCLA because other clusters chose to get cardiovascular care from other Los Angeles hospitals. Until these other hypotheses are evaluated, along with rigorous genetic experiments, we are unable to completely understand the pathways that lead from biology to disease in this study.
