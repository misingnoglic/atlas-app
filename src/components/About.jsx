      <Typography variant="h6">Background </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
      This study involves concepts of ancestry, race, ethnicity, and identity. These terms have a fraught history, especially in the United States, which is the context of this study. This history is complicated further in medicine, where non-White people have a long history of discrimination and abuse at the hands of the medical establishment. {"\n"} 

      The goal of this research was to examine different distributions of health traits in communities that share ancestry with each other. We strongly emphasize that our research does not support a genetic basis for any of the differences reported here. Instead, a more likely explanation is that complex sociocultural, environmental, and genetic factors all interact to shape how and why an individual would seek medical care. The communities reported here may have some overlap in these factors, leading to the differences observed. {"\n"}  

      Here, we attempt to define the relevant terms of the paper, along with what conclusions our research does and does not support. Further questions can be addressed to christa@g.ucla.edu {"\n"}
