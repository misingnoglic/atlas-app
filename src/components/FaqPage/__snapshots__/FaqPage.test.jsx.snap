        The goal of this research was to examine different distributions of health traits in clusters of patients that share
ancestry with each other. We strongly emphasize that our research does not support a genetic basis for any of the
differences reported here. Instead, a more likely explanation is that complex sociocultural, environmental, and 
genetic factors all interact to shape how and why an individual would seek medical care. The clusters reported here 
may have some overlap in these factors, leading to the differences observed.

        We used an unsupervised machine learning algorithm coupled with
genetic information to identify clusters of related people who visit
the UCLA Health System. These clusters might be a more effective and
precise way to study people in the context of medical research.
Using our approach, we were able to study clusters that would be
hard to identify via self-reported data alone. Some of these
clusters represent groups of people who are not regularly studied in
American biomedical literature, like Iranian Jews or Armenians.

        We found that some of the clusters we identified had health
differences. These differences could be in terms of the diagnoses
the people in the cluster received, what specialties they visited,
or the genetic risk variants common in the cluster. Our data can be
used to examine health disparities that exist in Los Angeles, and
the complex generative processes that might be causing different
clusters to access care.

        The results here are strictly correlative. The reasons why a cluster
is more likely to be diagnosed with a specific disease or see a
particular doctor are complicated and not necessarily related to
their actual health. Factors that could affect how a cluster
interacts with the health system could relate to insurance coverage,
socioeconomic status, biases of the medical establishment, travel
time to the hospitals, among many others. Thus, belonging to a
cluster is not causal for any of the associations reported in our
work.

        Furthermore, the sample we are using is not random. Firstly, the
participants are people who visited the hospital and had a blood
draw, which is a subset of the population. Beyond that, people who
agree to take part in a biobank are likely not representative of the
general population. Lastly, the setting of this study was Southern
California, and most participants live in the US full time. It is
unclear how a cluster of people from the US generalize to analogous
populations outside of the US.

        A natural question to ask, then, is if these associations are not casual, are they useful?
We argue that they are, because they provide opportunities to learn about the

        <a
          href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/life-stages-populations/infant-mortality/toolkit/understanding-sdoh.html"

          structural and social determinants of health
        </a>
        
that may be affecting care in Los Angeles. For example, if a cluster is visiting an emergency room 
more often than other clusters, that could provide an opportunity to investigate whether there is a 
structural cause for this difference. Maybe people in that cluster have worse insurance coverage or 
they travel farther to a doctor’s office. We hope our work provides the foundation to look at these 
questions and design interventions to address potential inequities.

         and speaks to the shared
evolutionary history of humans. The research presented here, then, is almost paradoxical: how can we identify
such fine-scale genetic differences, if humans are so similar to each other? The answer is that the differences
truly are fine-scale. The approximately 0.01% of the genome where humans differ can lead to

research, do not dispute the fundamental similarities between all humans.

identical to the DNA of each of your parents. As the distance between you and another person on your family tree
grows (e.g. grandparent, great-grandparent, etc.), your DNA becomes less identical to that person.

          DNA undergoes recombination.
        </a>
        
This means, for example, that a pair of your mom’s chromosomes might swap DNA, and you end up inheriting some
proportion of DNA from both your grandmother and your grandfather in the same region. Because of recombination,
the amount of DNA you share with your ancestors gets progressively smaller with time, but it also means that you
are a

         originating from different ancestors. In this
context, genetic ancestry could simply mean that you share stretches of your genome with your family members.

        In this work, however, and often in informal language, genetic ancestry often means how you share DNA with
people from a specific geographic area or cultural group. This is because we share DNA with a long line of
individuals, way beyond what we could recognize as our family tree. Many of these distant ancestors primarily
interacted with others in a similar geographic area (e.g., the Austrian Alps) or within a sociocultural boundary
(e.g., others who spoke Urdu). Over time, our ancestors accumulated unique mutations that they passed on to their
offspring. Since they often married or mated with other people from their area or culture, these mutations stayed
in the gene pool in that group. These patterns often persist into the present moment, as religion, language, and
ancestry often still influence marriage decisions. Thus, today there are 

        <a
          href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/about"
        >
          patterns of DNA mutations

         that exist at higher prevalence in a
particular location or group due to a shared history.

        Genetic ancestry is a continuum, which makes it particularly difficult to encapsulate. For example, it is common
for an individual to have parents with different ancestral backgrounds. Consider the offspring of a woman from
Population A and a man from Population B. While it is correct to say that the baby has ancestry shared equally
with Population A and B, at any given position on one of the baby’s chromosomes, it is either completely Population A or Population B. This subtle difference is the difference between

        >
          global ancestry and local ancestry.
        </a>
         Both concepts might be useful to biomedical researchers, and both are regularly studied. And crucially, neither concept determines how the baby will ultimately identify, which could be completely divorced from ancestry altogether (see below).

        It is important to note that this conceptualization of genetic ancestry does not necessarily map on to the concepts
of nations that we are familiar with today. Many states that exist today did not exist in even the recent past.
In some places, such as

relate to our understanding of the world today. Furthermore, colonialism has

          profoundly changed
        </a>
         patterns of genetic relatedness across the
globe through voluntary migration and forced migration in the form of slavery. Genetic ancestry may also not
map directly onto geography. There have been many factors that affected who our ancestors had children with,
including religion or caste. All of these things shape genetic ancestry and contribute to the complicated
relationship between genetic ancestry and race/ethnicity, discussed more below.

         They have meaning only within the society in which they were conceived.

        Today in the United States, people typically identify as one of several races delineated by the US Census, such as White, Black, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander. Ethnicity in the US Census is usually considered to be Hispanic or not Hispanic. Race and ethnicity can interact in complex ways with an individual’s identity, which may be limited to their race/ethnicity (e.g. someone identifying as white non-Hispanic) or could span cultural lines separate from the typical US designations (e.g. Pakistani Muslim).

        Therefore, the concept of genetic ancestry is completely separate from how an individual identifies in terms of race/ethnicity. It is important to emphasize that both concepts are useful in biomedical contexts. For example, despite there being no biological underpinning to race, different racial groups in America have been 
        <a
          href="https://www.urban.org/features/structural-racism-america"
        >
          treated differently
        </a>
         in the modern era and historically, and different treatment can ultimately lead to health inequities. Race and identity are highly relevant factors in a person’s experience of the world, including their 
        <a
          href="https://www.bmj.com/racism-in-medicine"
        >
          medical care.
        </a>
         Thus, both race and genetic ancestry are crucial variables to study, depending on the specific scientific question being asked.

         (IBD) segments. To be identical by descent means that two stretches of DNA (from two people or possibly, within an individual) are the same due to shared ancestry. People who share large amounts of IBD with each other are more likely to be closely related. However, even small amounts of IBD shared between people can be informative, since they indicate shared ancestors in the more distant past.

        In this study, we used an algorithm to make a network of individuals. We used a machine-learning algorithm to identify clusters of people who shared more IBD between them than other groups of people. IBD cluster detection done in this manner has been shown to find groups who likely have genetic ancestors in common. This approach is functionally different from assigning an ancestry at each point in the genome but can still give us information on how individuals in our biobank are related, which is useful when asking about health risks in the Los Angeles area.

        We were particularly interested in IBD in the context of a biobank because it offered more information about clusters than information contained in the EHR alone. While doctor’s offices regularly take down information about race and ethnicity, sometimes it may be inaccurate or not included for whatever reason. As a result, our sample size would decrease, and substantially limit our ability to identify health inequities.

        Additionally, the racial and ethnic categories typically included on forms are usually simplistic. For example, there is

          currently no category
        </a>
         for “Middle Eastern or North African” on most race/ethnicity questionnaires. This would limit our ability to identify clusters of people with these ancestries, which could even contribute to inequities in health research.

          href="https://icd.codes/?term=headache"
        >
          code for headaches,
        </a>
         for example. Further, for some analyses, the level of specificity offered in ICD codes might not be meaningful (e.g., it might not matter if the person was the motorcycle driver or passenger if you are just interested in traffic injuries overall). Thus, PheCodes were developed to 
        <a
          href="https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes"
        >
          group related ICD codes together.

         Recent work has shown that this might be more

        The results displayed here are statistical associations, meaning that we observed a relationship between cluster membership and ever being diagnosed with a PheCode (or visiting a specialty or a zip code). These observations can be considered robust under some mathematical guidelines commonly used in science (such as 
        <a
          href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4210"
        >
          p-values

         and

          false discovery rate
        </a>
         ), but they do not say anything about causality. In other words, there may be some observed correlation of individuals within a particular cluster who are more likely to be diagnosed with a PheCode than individuals in another cluster, however, this does not mean cluster membership is causal for these differences.

        There are many possible explanations for what we see in our data. Of course, the population could truly have that disease at a higher rate than other groups. This is easy to imagine in cases like sickle cell anemia. We observed that sickle cell anemia is more likely to be diagnosed in Black people in our study, and there has been a large body of 
        <a
          href="https://europepmc.org/article/NBK/nbk1377"

          medical research

         before our study demonstrating that individuals with African ancestry are in fact 
        <a
          href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html#:~:text=SCD%20occurs%20among%20about%201,sickle%20cell%20trait%20(SCT"
        >
          more likely
        </a>
        .) to have sickle cell anemia than people from other groups. However, many of the associations we found have less clear explanations. It is possible that certain groups receive or seek care at greater rates or that there is an environmental factor affecting the diagnoses. In some cases, it might be true that certain doctors that see specific populations are more likely to code an illness in a specific way. There are likely biases in the way diseases are diagnosed. For example, in sickle cell anemia, it could be true that doctors are familiar with the research on the association between the disease and Black Americans, and thus test or treat it at higher rates in this group, despite it also being common in

        Taken together, all these considerations mean that there is likely a complex explanation for the results that we see. Future research directions can focus on untangling the structural processes (like race, socioeconomic factors, sexual and gender identity, or others) that cause patients to receive a particular diagnosis to address health disparities.

        In this study, we did not examine the relationship between genetics
and disease. While it may be true that some of the associations that
we observe may have some genetic basis, the data presented here are
not sufficient to make these kinds of conclusions. Instead, there
could be other social and structural factors contributing to the
associations.

        A concrete example is that while we observed that the Armenian
cluster was more likely to receive codes relating to heart
transplants, the actual reason for this could be more complicated
than genetics alone. Perhaps people in the Armenian cluster share
some sort of unmeasured environmental factor that affects heart
health. Or, maybe the Armenian cluster doesn’t receive more heart
transplants overall, they just receive more at UCLA because other
clusters chose to get cardiovascular care from other Los Angeles
hospitals. Until these other hypotheses are evaluated, along with
rigorous genetic experiments, we are unable to completely understand
the pathways that lead from biology to disease in this study.
